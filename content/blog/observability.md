Observability is a term borrowed from the field of control systems where we measure the internal state of the system based on the external output. In the context of software, observability refers to the ability to understand what is happening inside an application or infrastructure by collecting, correlating, and analyzing key data - metrics, logs and traces.

Observability is not the same as monitoring. Monitoring is more of a pull based mechanism where we collect predefined metrics and check if system is running as expected. Observability, on the other hand, is broader and more dynamic. It allows you to explore unknowns, debug, and understand the system behavior, especially in scenarios that werenâ€™t anticipated when the system was built. Monitoring tells us if a system was wrong but Observability helps you why it's wrong and helps you reason about your system performance.
