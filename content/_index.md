# Hi! 👋 I am Harshavardhan

I'm a software engineer based in Chennai, currently at Citigroup where I work on low-latency trade processing systems, observability platforms, and developer tooling. I'm drawn to problems at the intersection of systems, performance, and developer experience. I use this blog to reflect on all three.

I recently wrapped up my Master's in CS from Georgia Tech (OMSCS) while working full-time — would not recommend for your sleep schedule, but would recommend for everything else.

### What I'm building

- **[Pouch](https://github.com/harshavardhan98/pouch)** — A privacy-focused link-sharing browser extension, an alternative to Pocket. Initial version submitted to the Chrome Web Store; working on cross-browser sync and mobile support.
- **TickTockMail** — A disposable email service in the spirit of 10minutemail. Currently in the architecture and design phase.
- **SQLite JDBC Driver** — A high-performance alternative to the Xerial SQLite driver. Early-stage research.

### What's on my radar

- **Pocket JVM** — A toy JVM implementation from scratch, inspired by Jato JVM.
- **JQwik Alternative** — A property-based testing library for Java.
- **UI Fuzzing Library** — A fuzz testing framework for Android and iOS.
- **Chennai Data Project** — Collecting and documenting public data about Chennai: transit ridership, reservoir levels, air quality, employment growth, industrial investment, and more.
