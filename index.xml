You merged the PR, the pipeline is green and deployment is successful.
Everything looks fine until you receive a Slack message regarding &amp;ldquo;API latency is a bit high and the customers are complaining?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You open your Grafana dashboard and you notice that the P99 lateny is slightly higher than usual but you are not sure what is the root cause. This post is a walk through of the JVM metrics you need to check and how to interpret them to find the root cause of the issue. I will try to provide an intuitive understanding of what &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; graph shape looks like and what shapes on graph should make you nervous.
The metrics discussed in this post are the standard metrics exposed by the JVM prometheus exporter/OTEL agent.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
